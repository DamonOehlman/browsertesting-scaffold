# Browser Testing Scaffold

This is a simple repository that demonstrates an opinionated approach to testing using [testling](https://github.com/substack/testling) and [tape](https://github.com/substack/tape).  The process is also supported and compatible with [zuul](https://github.com/defunctzombie/zuul) which is equally awesome and should be used if it is better suited to your situation.
